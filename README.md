# Harmonia Theme

**Harmonia** is a meticulously crafted theme suite for Visual Studio Code. It comes in two variants - **Dark** and **Light** - both designed for long, focused development sessions with soft, thoughtful visuals and semantic clarity.

---

## 🌗 Purpose

Harmonia was created to support developers who value:

- Visual peace over visual noise
- Focused, low-glare interfaces (in both light and dark modes)
- Carefully tuned syntax contrast
- A UI that fades into the background, not fights for attention

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎨 **Calm and cohesive palettes** - whether in dark or light, colors are expressive but balanced
- 🧠 **Semantic clarity** - functions, variables, parameters, and keywords are visually distinct
- 💬 **Legible comments** - softly styled to blend in without disappearing
- 📄 **Enhanced Markdown support** - styled blockquotes, headers, inline code, and horizontal rules
- 💻 **Consistent terminal colors** - ANSI styling designed to match the theme mood
- 🧩 **Language-first design** - tuned for PHP, JS, JSON, Docker, config/log files, and more

## 🎨 Color Philosophy

### Harmonia Dark
- `#1a1b26` - soft, deep background (never pure black)
- `#d0d0e0` - consistent, low-contrast foreground text
- Accents: `#c574dd`, `#88c6c3`, `#a3d9a5` - expressive yet quiet
- Structure: `#5a5f7a` for dividers, quotes, and spacing

### Harmonia Light
- `#e6e8eb` - light, muted background (never pure white)
- `#2e3440` - rich but readable foreground text
- Accents: `#a454cb`, `#7ebf87`, `#6eaadb` - pleasant without harshness
- Structure: `#b4b8c2` and `#cdd0d5` for subtle grid and guides

Both variants aim to reduce fatigue while keeping code readable and environments beautiful.
